# Influencer Detail Explanation

## Governing

### Types of manpower

* People: Basic manpower, works on farms, produces food, extra food (or not enough food) will lead to more people with a percentage. Very low combat strength.
* Student: Extracts from people, then in 2 political turns they can further specialize below. Itself has low combat strength and research output.
* Worker: These worker are for special buildings (center etc.), they are extracted directly from People, and while being worker they stay out of population growth calculation. retire when work's done.
* Science: the default specialization for student, produces research points to then strengthen any aspect of any thing. retire after 5 turns.
* Army: Land combat units, basic combat strength (as unit). Detailed in battle folder. retire after 3 turns.
* Panzer: higher level land combat, faster and stronger. retire after 3 turns.
* Navy: Water combat units, detailed in battle folder. retire after 3 turns.
* Airforce: .... retire after 3 turns.

### manpower interaction with map (locationing, distribution, overexpansion control)

Each power must have at least one people center, student center, science center. Initial territory can guarantee placement of these centers.
After that, for people to generate food, ariable land is needed, and there's a max capacity for these lands. When people have no land to work, no food is produced.
Ariable land, acquiring land, unworkable land will be explained in other places.

People will eventually unable to work further tiles, then new centers is a good choice, which will need worker to build quite some turns.

### Special things from other grand strategy games

* Zero storage (memoryless?), extra/unsatisfied needs immediately result in population change.
* only one resource called "food", which is actually all civilian industrial production.

## Diplomacy

### Available ations

* (Open) Alliance.
* (Secret) Alliance.
* War Declaration.
* Enter existing war standing with sb.
* Peace treaty.
* Trade of any of the above and food production and territorial concession. (you can concess territory to gain alliance with certain influencer)

### Special notes

* None of these will actually put limit to what you can do. For example, you can walk in and kill open alliance's population. Just be prepared for any catastrophic diplomatic consequences you would cause.
* Except secrete alliance, all others will notify all players. At the time you kill any pop of another influencer, all players will know the undeclared war state. You can declare right at the time of doing it, but that doesn't really change much on your diplomatic situation.

## A political turn

* For here one turn means a political term (planned 10 actual turns).
* Each turn, total food production based on factors, total consumption from manpower is calculated, extra/unsatisfied food causes people population change.
* Then players are asked to direct convocated student to different high-level manpower, and select new student amount.
* Then total research point is calculated, and player's asked to investigate them to places.
* Player can do diplomatic actions and then end the turn.
* Retired high-level manpower went back to being people.
